# Welcome to my Github !

## Who am I ?
I am a 42 Paris Student studying Software Development and I am looking to start my mid cursus 6 months internship.

## What is [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) ?

If you haven't heard of it already, 42 is a peer-to-peer learning Software Developement School which gives us many different projects covering all domains of Software Developement, it is notorious for being very selective and forming students to be complete, rigorous and independant developers. This school is great in the sense that it teaches you to figure out things out by yourself and spend time understanding the theory behind each project to build the most effective solution. Make sure to look at each projects I have already done to understand the skills I gained and what I achieved, they all have a detailed README explaining what was developped :smile:.
